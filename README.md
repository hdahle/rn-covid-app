# React Native Carousel and Tab-based navigation

Goal: Learn about React Native by building a marginally useful Android/iOS app

## Expo.io

Using expo.io and Expo Go on the client side was a nice experience. Highly recommended as an easy way to learn about React Native app development

## How I initialized the project

cd project
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
expo install @expo/vector-icons
expo install react-native-screens
expo install react-native-snap-carousel
